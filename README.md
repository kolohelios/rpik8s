Raspberry Pi K8s stuff


## Stuff:

- Raspbian Lite (32bit image) on Samsung 32 GB EVO Plus micro SD card
- 4 Raspberry Pi 4B, 4 GB of RAM, CanaKit USB C power adapters, 1 ft. gigabit Ethernet cables, and a four pi stackable case
- Linksys 8-port gigabit switch

## Initialization

For each pi, create an empty file in /boot on the micro SD called ssh (with no extension); this will allow you to connect to the pis remotely
